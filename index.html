    <p><img src="images/dallas_college.png" alt="Dallas College Logo" id="dallas">My goal is to be a website designer
        one day very soon. Right now, I am attending <a href="https://www.dallascollege.edu"> <span>Dallas
                College</span>
        </a> to learn the skills I will need to be a successful website designer. This semester alone I am learning
        about JavaScript, Java, and Photoshop!</p>
    <p>My long term goals are to work for myself and create websites for clients freelance. I would love the ability to
        work with small to medium size businesses and even individuals to create the websites of their dreams! I would
        also love the freedom of creating my own schedule and having that flexibility to create a desirable work/life
        balance.</p>
    <p>Most of all, I just want to create a career doing something that I love doing - <span id="websites">designing
            websites</span>!</p>
